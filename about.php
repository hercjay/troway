                        <p>
							Born by the ardent desire to protect the environment of Anambra state from the problems caused by solid waste generation and poor handling, the then military government in power established a full-fledged agency called the Anambra State Environmental Sanitation Agency(ANSESA).
						<p>
							Years later a great limitation ensued, caused by the inability to cope with the rising demand for waste management problems by the said organization. This led to the formation of a new waste management system called the Anambra State Environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA). In 2011, ANSEPA was dissolved and a new board known as Anambra State Waste Management Authority (ASWAMA) was formed. Consequently, ASWAMA controls waste management in Anambra State, as empowered by the Laws of Anambra State.
						</p>
							What are our core duties and responsibilities?
						<p>
							The agency works under the State Ministry of Environment, sponsored by the Anambra State Government, and is charged with the following major responsibilities: 
						</p>
							Removal, collection, and disposal of domestic commercial and industrial generated waste. 
							Cleaning and maintenance of Public drainage facilities
							Cleaning streets of Awka, Onitsha, and Nnewi urban areas
							Removal and disposal of scrapped vehicles abandoned at legal points within the State.
							Sweeping of major streets/roads in the State
						<p>
							ASWAMA  Board
							Governing Board (hereinafter referred to as Board) 
							The Managing Director.
							The Chairman appointed by the Governor also  called the Chief Executive Officer
